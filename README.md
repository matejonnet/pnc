Project-ncl
===========
A system for managing, executing, and tracking builds


Building
--------
Requirements:

* JDK 8
* Maven 3.2

The default build is executed by running `mvn clean install`.<br />
By default the tests that require remote services and integration tests are disabled.<br />

Integration tests are placed in module "integration-test" and most of them needs a JEE server (Wildfly or EAP).
In order to run them you need to specify `-Pcontainer-tests`.

Remote tests requires turning on additional Maven profile - `-Premote-tests`.
In order to run remote and integration tests you have to specify remote services location and credentials by editing configuration file `common/src/main/resources/pnc-config.json` and use both profiles (`-Pcontainer-tests` and `-Premote-tests`)<br />
By default the configuration file uses env variables, you can set required variables (see file for list of them) instead of editing the file itself.<br />
If you want to use a different (external) config file location you can define a path to it with `-Dpnc-config-file=/path/to/pnc-config.json`.


Integration and Container tests
-------------------------------
There is a slight difference between **integration** and **container** test. By a **container** test we understand a test which needs a JavaEE server to run.
An **integration** test checks if several modules work correctly together.


Module Overview
---------------
* `datastore`: Implementation of spi:org.jboss.pnc.spi.datastore
* `jenkins-build-driver`: Implementation of spi:org.jboss.pnc.spi.builddriver
* `maven-repository-manager`: Implementation of spi:org.jboss.pnc.spi.repositorymanager
* `build-coordinator`: Contains implementations of action-controllers, which include the business logic for orchestrating builds, test runs, etc. Action controllers are used to isolate logic from the REST API, so it can be reused in embedded scenarios
* `model`: Contains domain model for the orchestrator. This is just model classes + serialization helpers, and would also be suitable for writing a java client api to support integration
* `rest`: REST API. This is a series of classes that use JAX-RS to translate HTTP communications to calls into the action controllers in the core, and format any output (such as constructing resource URLs, etc.)
* `spi`: Contains all SPI interfaces the orchestrator will use to coordinate its sub-services for provisioning environments and repositories, triggering builds, storing domain objects. It is meant to be used in conjunction with pnc-model
* `processes`: Contains jBPM processes for PNC
* `ui`: Contains the source code for the angular ui.
* `web`: Contains resources to be served via the web, this module sucks in the ui jar and holds the swagger REST API documentation.


Environmental variables
-----------------------
#TODO update a list to mactch latest config or remove and point to config file itself to not require to keep them in sync

Environment variables, which can be used to set up application:

* `PNC_JENKINS_USERNAME` - Username of user created in Jenkins server inside the Docker container
* `PNC_JENKINS_PASSWORD` - Password of user specified with `PNC_JENKINS_USERNAME`
* `PNC_JENKINS_URL` - URL of Jenkins instance dedicated or in docker container
* `PNC_JENKINS_PORT` - Port of Jenkins dedicated or in docker container specified with `PNC_JENKINS_URL`
* `PNC_APROX_URL` - URL to AProx repository
* `PNC_DOCKER_IP` - IP address of host with Docker daemon
* `PNC_DOCKER_CONT_USER` - User account in image used in Docker
* `PNC_DOCKER_CONT_PASSWORD` - User's password set up by variable `PNC_DOCKER_CONT_USER`
* `PNC_DOCKER_IMAGE_ID` - ImageID of image on Docker host
* `PNC_DOCKER_PROXY_SERVER` - IP address or hostname of proxy server
* `PNC_DOCKER_PROXY_PORT` - port of proxy server where it is listening
* `PNC_DOCKER_IMAGE_FIREWALL_ALLOWED` - List of allowed destinations by firewall in Docker container. <br /> Format: \<IPv4>:\<Port>(,\<IPv4>:\<Port>)+
You can set it to "all" and network isolation will be skipped, in case of not setting it up at all
all network traffic will be dropped
* `PNC_EXT_REST_BASE_URL` - Base URL of REST endpoint services to be accessed from external resources
* `PNC_EXT_OAUTH_USERNAME` - Username to be able to authenticate against pnc authentication service provider
* `PNC_EXT_OAUTH_PASSWORD` -  Password to be able to authenticate against pnc authentication service provider
* `PNC_BPM_USERNAME` -  Username user to authenticate against remote BPM server for build signal callbacks
* `PNC_BPM_PASSWORD` -  Password for `PNC_BPM_USERNAME`


Building for Production (Postgresql DB)
---------------------------------------
A Maven profile called `production` is provided to configure the appropriate settings to build a deployment file which is compatible with the postgresql database.

    mvn install -Pproduction

TODO: this is not working currently, integration tests are always run against HSQLDB
The container tests can also be run against postgresql by activating the `container-tests` profile, and the `production` profile.

    mvn install -Pproduction,container-tests


Set up of Docker host
------------
This part describes an expected way how to set up host with running Docker daemon with systemd.
Currently is used Docker daemon, which listens on unprotected Docker control socket (port 2375).

Steps to set up Docker daemon:

1. Install docker with `yum install docker-io` (the package on Fedora 22 was renamed to _docker_)
2. Edit /etc/sysconfig/docker file to enable tcp connection, using external data storage on disk outside root filesystem and you can set up an additional docker image registry to official hub.docker.com:

```
OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock -g /mnt/docker/data'
INSECURE_REGISTRY='--insecure-registry <your-internal-remote-docker-registry>'
```

3. Enable `docker` service: Run `sudo systemctl enable docker`
4. Start `docker` service: Run `sudo systemctl start docker`
5. Verify the service: Run `docker -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 version`. If you get response in 1-2 seconds without errors, the service is running.
6. Add image to Docker daemon: The Docker daemon has to have imported image, which is specified by environment variable `PNC_DOCKER_IMAGE_ID` (or is set in pnc-config.json file) You can use `docker pull` to download image from remote repository or `docker build` to create image from Dockerfile.


##Authentication:
This project comes with possibility to be secured. Security is delivered via Keycloak project http://keycloak.jboss.org/.
To be able to turn on whole project on secure side you need 2 parts to fulfill.
1. **Have running and configured Keycloak server instance.** <br/>
2. **Build & configure security for your PNC installation.**

###Authentication - prepare Keycloak server<br/>
**PRE-REQUIREMENTS:** <br/>

Install your Keycloak server standalone or in Openshift according to 
* http://keycloak.github.io/docs/userguide/html/server-installation.html.
* http://keycloak.github.io/docs/userguide/html/openshift.html
<br/>

**Configure Keycloak server**<br/>

1. Create your realm 
By default the Keycloak server comes with "master realm", which is for demo purpose, so please create your own realm.
<br/>
2. Put your Direct Grant API on at https://`<your-server>`/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/`<your-realm>`/login-settings
<br/>
3. Add/Create your users via https://`<your-server>`/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/`<your-realm>`/users
<br/>
4. Define roles and assign users to it via https://`<your-server>`/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/`<your-realm>`/roles
<br/>
5. Create 3 client app's at https://`<your-server>`/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/`<your-realm>`/clients 
<br/>
6. First client app for pncweb UI with:
  * Client Protocol = openid-connect
  * Access Type = confidental
  * Valid Redirect URIs = http://localhost:8080/pnc-web/*  (Please add URI's for different host's as you need for your installed pnc Web UI's)
  * Go to "Installation" tab and select "Keycloak JSON" format and copy&paste or download the installation.
7. Second client app for pncrest with:
  * Client Protocol = openid-connect
  * Access Type = confidental
  * Valid Redirect URIs = http://localhost:8080/pnc-rest/*  (Please add as much URI's as you need for your installed pnc rest's)
  * Go to "Installation" tab and select "Keycloak JSON" format and copy&paste or download the installation.
8. Third client app for pncdirect with:
  * Client Protocol = openid-connect
  * Direct Grants Only = ON
  * Access Type = public
  * Go to "Installation" tab and select "Keycloak JSON" format and copy&paste or download the installation.
<br/>

**HINTS** <br/>

1. pncrest keycloak.json additional props -> use these below for skipping ssl & defining rest for accepting only access_token for authentication/authorization.
  * "ssl-required": "none",
  * "bearer-only" : true,
2. pncweb keycloak.json additional props -> look at http://keycloak.github.io/docs/userguide/html/ch08.html#adapter-config to find more about adapter's config.
  * "ssl-required" : "none",
  * "use-resource-role-mappings" : false,
  * "enable-basic-auth" : false,
  * "enable-cors" : true,
  * "cors-max-age" : 1000,
  * "cors-allowed-methods" : "POST,PUT,DELETE,GET",
  * "bearer-only" : false,

         

###Authentication - build & configure your PNC<br/>
By default PNC project comes with no security at all, it is up to you to turn it on.
In case you want to enable authentication use `-Dauth=true` together with your build command.
Enabling authentication means following<br/>

1. Your backend REST endpoints will become secured
  * inside rest.war under folder WEB-INF are added files from rest/src/main/auth
  * keycloak.json file is configuration file managing connection to Keycloak server
  * web.xml file where you define security-constraints & security-roles, which specifies users authrorization's to each REST endpoint
2. Your pnc web UI gain the SSO ability and authentication via Keycloak login page.
  * with your first unauthenticated session you will be redirected from pnc web UI into Keycloak login page.
  * you will be asked to provide your credentials.
  * after successful log-in you will be redirected back to pnc web UI.
3. Configure your JEE server (EAP) for keycloak
  * Use -Dauth.eap.home=``<path to your EAP installation>`` with you build command, if you want EAP configure for Keycloak.
  According the http://docs.jboss.org/keycloak/docs/1.1.0.Final/userguide/html/ch08.html#jboss-adapter-installation installation will be performed on server for the given path.


Using an alternate JBoss server location
----------------------------------------
By default, the Maven build will download JBoss EAP and extract it to a local directory such as `target/jboss-eap-6.4`.  However, you can also configure and run tests in an alternate JBoss EAP location.  The first step is to install the necessary HSQL and Postgresql JDBC drivers and datasources.

    $ cd test-arquillian-container
    $ mvn clean install -Pconfigure-test-container -Dtest.server.build.dir=/path/to/eap/server

The container-tests can be run against this JBoss server using similar command line options.

    $ mvn clean install -Pcontainer-tests -Dtest.server.build.dir=/path/to/eap/server


Manually Configuring the Datasource for HSQL DB
--------------------------------------
You will need to download the [hsqldb jar file](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hsqldb/hsqldb/2.3.3/hsqldb-2.3.3.jar) and copy the jar file into the standalone/deployments directory of your JBoss server.  Check the server log to see that the driver deployed successfully.

From the EAP/Wildfly admin console, select Configuration-->Connector-->Datasources.
Click the "Add" button to add a new datasource and set the required fields.

    Name: NewcastleTestDS
    JNDI Name: java:jboss/datasources/NewcastleTestDS
    JDBC Driver: hsqldb-2.3.3.jar
    Connection URL: jdbc:hsqldb:mem:newcastletestmemdb

You can test the connection before saving the datasource settings.  Finally, enable the datasource, and it is ready to be used by the newcastle application.


Installing Postgres for Development
------------------------------------

Basic installation instructions for Postgres on recent versions of Fedora can be found on the Fedora wiki: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PostgreSQL

(Optional) In addition to the postgresql server, it's useful to install the gui admin tool pgadmin3 (yum install pgadmin3).

Once postgresql is installed and started, you can create and modify the databases using the psql command.

Connect to postgres

    $ psql -h localhost newcastle -U <ROOT_USERNAME>

Create the user "newcastle
Create user

    postgres=# CREATE USER newcastle WITH PASSWORD newcastle;

Create the newcastle database
Create newcastle database

    postgres=# CREATE DATABASE newcastle OWNER newcastle;

Once the database is created, the schema can be built using the SQL files included with the newcastle source code, or it can be created automatically if it doesn't exist.


Configuring the Datasource
--------------------------
You will need to download and install the PostgreSQL JDBC driver into Wildfly (https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html).  Copy the postgresql jdbc driver jar into the standalone/deployments directory of your JBoss server.  Check the server log to see whether the driver deployed successfully.

From the EAP/Wildfly admin console, select Configuration-->Connector-->Datasources.
Click the "Add" button to add a new datasource and set the required fields.

    Name: NewcastleDS
    JNDI Name: java:jboss/datasources/NewcastleDS
    JDBC Driver: postgresql-9.3.jar
    Connection URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/newcastle
    Username: newcastle
    Password: newcastle

You can test the connection before saving the datasource settings.

UI Module Compilation Errors
----------------------------
Due to the need to integrate a modern frontend workflow into a maven project there can occasionally be some complications in a build. Some data is cached by the UI that is not completely cleaned by running `maven clean`. In case of strange build failures with the UI module please try running: `maven clean -Dfrontend.clean.force` and this will completely clean out all data. NOTE: with this profile enabled build times will increase by a few minutes as the ui build system will have to retrieve a large amount of previously cached data.
